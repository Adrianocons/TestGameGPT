# TestGameGPT

This repository contains a simple roguelite, turn-based strategy prototype inspired by *The Battle of Polytopia*.
The map is randomly generated on each run and players' units move automatically for demonstration.

For Windows-specific setup instructions, see [WINDOWS_SETUP.md](WINDOWS_SETUP.md).

## Running

```bash
python -m polythorogue.cli
```

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
pytest
```
